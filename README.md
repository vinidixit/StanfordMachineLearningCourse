# StanfordMachineLearningCourse
This repository consists of my Octave codes implemented during during my Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng.
It consists of various coding assignments dont while implementing machine learning algorithms and applications.
The algorithms consists of various kind of cost functions, optimizers, gradient updates and finding best parameters for the decision boundary.
