# StanfordMachineLearningCourse
This repository consists of my Octave codes implemented during during my Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng.
It consists of various coding assignments done while implementing machine learning algorithms and its applications.
The algorithms consists of vectorized implementation of various kind of cost functions, optimizers, gradient updates and finding best parameters for the decision boundary.

Some of the algorithms -
## Linear Regression with linear and non-linear decision boundaries
## Regularized Logistic Regression for linear and non-linear decision boundaries
