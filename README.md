# Stanford's Machine Learning Course/Certification
This repository consists of my Matlab codes implemented during my Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng.
It consists of various coding assignments done while implementing machine learning algorithms and its applications.
The algorithm's implementaions consist of <b>vectorized</b> implementation of various kind of cost functions, optimizers, gradient updates and finding best parameters for the decision boundary.

In the instructor's words - This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: 
<ul>
<li> Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).</li>
<li> Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).</li>
<li> Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).</li>
</ul>

Some of the uploaded implementations are -
<ul>
<li> <b>Linear Regression</b> with linear and non-linear decision boundaries</b></li>
<li> <b>Regularized Logistic Regression</b> for linear and non-linear decision boundaries</b></li>
<li> <b>One-vs-all multiclass logistic regression classifier</b> for image classification (with 97% training accuracy)</li>
<li> <b>Three layer Neural Network model</b> for image classification (with 96% training accuracy)</li>
<li> <b>Backpropagation algorithm</b> implementation for NN learning</li>
</ul>
