Desinged a 3 layer neural network.
Steps :
1. Random initialization for weight matrices for the layers.
2. Forward Propagation for computing the <b>regularized</b> cost function. Function computation at each neural unit.
3. Using backpropagation, identifying errors and gradients for weight matrices.
4. Tested gradients using numeric computation of calculating each gradient.
5. Used 50 iterations to fit the model by usung an advanced optimizing algorithm <b>fmincg</b>.
